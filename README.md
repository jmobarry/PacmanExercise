# PacmanExercise

Description:This is a simple Pacman Program that moves left to right within the screen and changes directions when it hits a x-axis boundary.

Usage: Open the HTML file named Pacman.html and click on the pacman to run the program. 

Support: You can reach me at my email jmobes217@gmail.com

Roadmap: I am to attempt down the line to add in sound effects if I learn how to.
